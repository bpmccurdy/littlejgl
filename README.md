A small java game library helpful for learning or building games from scratch
***
##Purpose
I started this library to learn the basics of a game, and how to efficiently run two dimensional graphics in java. It slowly has evolved into something more and more useful. 

##Documentation
I wrote this originally as just a test, never planning to make it public, I plan to document it properly.  
*~ If anyone would like to use this library send me a message and it would inspire me to document it much faster.*
