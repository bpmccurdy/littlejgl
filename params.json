It slowly has evolved into something more and more useful. \r\n\r\n##Documentation\r\nI wrote this originally as just a test, never planning to make it public, when I have time I plan to document it properly. \r\n   \r\n*If anyone would like to use this library send me a message and it would inspire me to document it much faster.*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
